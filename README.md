## Huh?

It's a Free WIP High Level Networking that works like Unity's Legacy Networking from Unity 4 and Photon PUN since they are DEAD-EASY

Built off <a href="https://github.com/RiptideNetworking/Riptide">Riptide Networking</a> by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@tomweiland">Tom Weiland</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/RiptideNetworking">Riptide Org.</a> (meaning you can switch the default transport layer (udp) to another layer like steam, tcp, epic etc) 🥹
